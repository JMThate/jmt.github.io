                    <p>Rejecting or denying cultural beliefs and traditions because they don&rsquo;t align with your own is harmful to other people&rsquo;s sense of belonging, and limits your ability to learn.</p>
                    <p>Racism can prevent many young people from ethnic and minority groups from accepting themselves. This can lead to poor mental health outcomes and long-term negative effects on their lives.</p>
                    <p>Be open to new ways of doing things at work, school, and in daily life. Speak to people with different backgrounds and embrace being challenged by new experiences.</p>

                    <p>When we think in stereotypes, we deny people their individuality. Everyone is unique: Not everyone in other racial groups is the same, just like not everyone in your racial group is the same. Stereotypes are harmful even when they are meant to be ‘light-hearted’.</p>
                    <p>In extreme cases, it casts a negative and false presumption onto entire groups or populations of people. In 2019, this led to the Christchurch Mosque Attacks where 51 Muslim people were murdered. In 2020, many Chinese and Asian people have been harassed due to stereotypes associated with COVID-19.</p>
                    <p>Silence racism by challenging and rejecting racial stereotypes. Seek new information and media sources that will help you avoid stereotypical narratives and assumptions.</p>

                            <p>Every day in Aotearoa, people experience racism which hurts them, prevents them from reaching their potential, or from living their lives feeling welcome and secure.</p>
                            <p>This incessant racism has a measurable impact on health and wellbeing, and it is contributed to even by those with good intentions. People may think one joke, one comment, one assumption, one stereotype doesn’t matter, that they are trivial, but they do matter – and the cumulative effect on people experiencing these is huge.</p>
                            <p>The Human Rights Commission calls everyone to listen to the Voice of Racism, to understand the experience, to appreciate the harm, and learn how to silence racism.</p>

                            <p>To create the Voice of Racism, more than 200 people shared their experiences of racism in New Zealand. These were curated into a collection of everyday experiences, to represent the racism that exists in the lives of many. These experiences include things that were said to them verbally and through people’s actions, and the internalised racism they live with.</p>
                            <p>These moments became ‘the Voice of Racism’, one collective voice that articulates the racism people exhibit both intentionally and unintentionally.</p>

                                    If possible, record the attack on a phone. Take note of the time and place, and as much detail as possible.</li>

                                    Report the attack. Call the Police. Alert the bus driver, manager or whoever is appropriate. If you can, ask a friend or bystanders to support you.</li>
